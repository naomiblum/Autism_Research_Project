# Theoretical Framework

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction
This research aims to explore the genetic overlap between spatial cognition and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Through genetic data analysis and machine learning, we aim to identify specific variations that may contribute to both conditions.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Genetic Basis of Autism and Spatial Cognition
### üî¨ Key Genes Associated with Autism
- **SHANK3, CHD8, SCN2A, NRXN1** ‚Äì involved in neural connectivity.
- **ADNP** ‚Äì affects brain development and cognition.

### üß† Genes and Spatial Cognition
- **FOXP2** ‚Äì linked to both language processing and spatial reasoning.
- **BDNF** ‚Äì plays a role in neural plasticity.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning in Genetic Research
- **Supervised learning** (Random Forest, XGBoost) for gene classification.
- **Unsupervised learning** (PCA, clustering) for pattern discovery.
- **Feature selection techniques** for identifying important genetic markers.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Hypothesis and Research Questions
- Is there a genetic overlap between autism and spatial cognition?
- Can machine learning models predict autism risk based on genetic patterns?
